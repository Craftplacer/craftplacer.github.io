### Are you actually still working on it?
Yes.

**Long Answer:** School and free-time basically decide if I'm in the mood or am able to work on it (even other projects I published), progress and features are tracked [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Craftplacer/CraftBot/projects/3).

### What can it do?
Refer to the [commands page](commands) and [features page](features).
