I participated in open-source projects like:

- [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) - Adding drag & drop for notifications ([a seemingly long awaited feature](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/pull/5540#issuecomment-847434414))

- [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu) - Contributing some small features like [porting over the Taiko Don mascot](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/8857).

- [osu-trainer](https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer) - Enhancing the <abbr title="Windows Forms User Interface">WinForms UI</abbr> with osu!lazer's design language.

- [SimpleClassicThemeTaskbar](https://github.com/WinClassic/SimpleClassicTheme.Taskbar) - Leading code architecture and refactoring as well as adding new features.

*and many other projects...*
