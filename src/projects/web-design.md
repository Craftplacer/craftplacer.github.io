# Web design work

I have taught web development myself and specialize in writing lightweight websites using static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Qualities

Websites I develop are:

- ... made in just HTML and CSS with using JavaScript (without any framework) only where its needed.
- ... hand-written, original and don't use any templates.
- ... seek out to be as small, accessible and optimized as possible.
