title: Why WinGet is bad
---

One thing that you'll find lacking on Windows when coming from Linux is the use of packages, easy to install software or data, with automatic dependency resolving and everything else.

## Story up until now

Windows doesn't have any package manager, just like any OS in its infancy.

macOS didn't have had to deal with this because applications are self-contained in simple to see and click files, to be put inside the "Applications" folder.

Linux only had binaries, then installers, until the package managers came.

Windows on the other hand... was based on MS-DOS, where no real concept of packages existed, at most only setup programs were a thing. Windows inherited this and never saw the need to improve.
