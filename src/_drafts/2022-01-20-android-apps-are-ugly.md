title: Android applications are just ugly

One common theme I come across certain apps, that aren't made by some big corporation, is the lack of theming, or even worse, being outdated.

You might say, this may be more common across <abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> apps.

Let's do a case study to prove my point.

# OpenTasks

Here you can see a fairly simple theme. The normal Material Design 2 treatment. Although, if you look closely, you can see tabs and their icons that kinda look [Android Jelly Bean-ish](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--E32YI8igIA/UgSBf5cox1I/AAAAAAAAAp4/AhJT6PSnjuw/s1600/Screenshot_2013-08-01-22-47-47.png).

Here you can see Material Design fading away again, and revealing the actual outdated design. It isn't really pleasing. It works, for sure, but it doesn't look good anymore for today, unless you only care about functionality.
