I believe a common theme across many websites and software is the following:

- Your website is chaotic, has too much content, and simply no organization or layout.
  
  **It looks bad.**

- Your website is full of content, but still comprehensible.
  
  **It is unique from the rest and looks good.**

- Your website is uses a off-the-shelf stylesheet.
  
  **It isn't that special, but nobody is going to judge you.**

- Your website tries to be innovate and strips out so much styling, that it is literally black on white paper
  
  **Some people might like it, but it's boring.**
