# Distancing myself from the retro web circles

I don't think I will ever join any circles about the old web. That primarily being web rings stemming from Neocities or similar. This doesn't mean I am not interested in having some sort of partnership, but from the bigger view I don't think I will(?)

Similar to myself, I think I will stand on my own feet (alone?)
