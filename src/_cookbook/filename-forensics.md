Certain file name formats leave many hints towards, **when** they were created and **where** they are from.

| Format                | Example                                   | Source              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext` | `{{ "now" | date: "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S" }}.jpg` | Twitter for Android |
